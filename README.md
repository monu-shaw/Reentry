@all of this repos colaborators. I have been trying to figur out a way to tell everyone that the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition(MPAC) has accepted my offer to collaborate with MPRN and Maine's Branch of NAMI in support of this site. This means that I have collected the 3 largest organizations involved with Prisoner Reentry in the state of Maine to keep this website running after we finish it. Also, with everyones help, we have compleated about 2/3's of the work towards finishing this project. I realy want to thank everyone helping on this project. I'm getting teary eyed. This platform is desperately needed here in Maine and our work will improve reentry for every single prisoner in this state from the day this site goes live.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This site is being built for Maine Community of reentry advocates and/or anyone who concerns themselves with sucsesfull prisoner reintergration. [NAMI](https://www.namimaine.org/), [MPRN](https://re-entrymaine.org/) and [MPAC](https://www.maineprisoneradvocacy.org) are all non-profit orginizations that are fully involved in prisoner reentry. They have agreed to maintain this site after it is launched and spread the word as fast as possible to get every resource in the state signed up to this site. I'm estimating a 2000+ user base from day one.    

I am a Tech student / Jr Full Stack Developer. I'm hoping to find some willing developers to donate some of there time and experiance to help me build this website for a worthy cause. This website will help thousands of Maine's Prisoners have a more successful reentry back into society.
