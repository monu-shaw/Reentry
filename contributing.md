# Contribution Guiedline
I'm trying to add issues as I go but any help would be great. Just run the site and take a look around, if you see something you want to fix, 
fix it. If you cant fix it make an issue. If you have questions, post it in the repo discussions. I realy need help with the reducers and seting up
user functionality. The sooner this site is ready for deployment, the sooner advocates can colaborate, and help people in need. 

#### Thank you for any support you contribute - 4-Leafs-Code

This site uses [firebase services](https://firebase.google.com/). I have my account set to accept domains from localhost, github.div, and gitpod.io. 
If you run into trouble logging in, you'll need to set up a project on firebase and update your web app's Firebase configuration. Locate firebase.js 
and update lines 8-16 with your own SDK.
